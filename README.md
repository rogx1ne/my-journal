# 📔 My Offline Journal (LOG)

This is a simple, offline-first personal journal application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. All journal entries are saved directly to your browser's `localStorage`, meaning your data never leaves your computer and is available immediately when you open the app.

## ✨ Features

* **Offline First:** All data is stored in `localStorage`. No internet connection or account required.
* **Light & Dark Themes:** Easily toggle between light and dark modes. Your preference is also saved in `localStorage`.
* **Responsive Design:** A two-column layout for desktop and a clean, single-column layout for mobile.
* **View Full Entries:** Click any entry in the list to open a modal popup and read the full text.
* **Scrollable List:** The entry list scrolls independently, even if you have hundreds of entries.
* **Built with Modern Tools:** Uses React hooks, TypeScript, and a fast Vite build environment.
